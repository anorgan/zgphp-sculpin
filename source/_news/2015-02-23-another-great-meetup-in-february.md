title: Another great meetup in February
---

Ahhh, one of those meetups where you could not find an empty chair. We had a tight schedule since we had to leave by
7pm and a lot of ground to cover.

Announcements
-------------
There are quite a few events going on in following months. First up, [WebCamp Ljubljana](http://2015.webcamp.si) 
on March 14th. You can expect to see lot of people from Zagreb there. Tickets are free, but you will have to grab them.
 
More good news from our neighbours - [Sarajevo will host first PHP meetup]() on March 24th. They found a suitable venue
