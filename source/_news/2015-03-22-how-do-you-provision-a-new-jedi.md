Honestly? We have no idea, but meetup in March was pretty cool. As usual, we had two speakers and some group announcements.


Announcements
=============
There is still time to plan your trip to Sarajevo this Tuesday. On March 24th there will be a 
[first ever PHP meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sarajevo-PHP-Meetup/events/220577214/). 

[GrUSP](https://twitter.com/grusp) is organising their annual [PhpDay 2015 conference](http://2015.phpday.it/) in 
Verona. They are in the process of making the final list of speakers so do not count that sweet early bird discount 
will last much longer. If you are interested in attending let us know as they were kind enough to give our user 
group a discount.

In Belgrade, PHP Serbia is once again organising themed conference - [SOLIDay](http://soliday.phpsrbija.rs/). 
It is dedicated to software architecture and good design principle and will host a list of great names from PHP world: 
[Shawn McCool](https://twitter.com/ShawnMcCool/), [Rob Allen](https://twitter.com/akrabat/), 
[Mathias Verraes](https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/), [Paweł Jędrzejewski](https://twitter.com/pjedrzejewski/), 
[Marco Pivetta](https://twitter.com/Ocramius/) and [Brandon Savage](https://twitter.com/brandonsavage/). Be on the 
lookout, as they will soon start selling tickets.

No words need to be spent on [Netgen](http://www.netgenlabs.com/), our dear friends and active supporters. 
They are again throwing a tutorial based conferences dedicated to 
[PHP & Symfony](http://2015.phpsummercamp.com/) and [eZ Publish](http://2015.ezsummercamp.com/).
You can expect three days of workshops and one very cool excursion.

Last but not least, our very own [WebCamp Zagreb 2015 conference](https://2015.webcampzg.org/). Call for papers is out,
we are [looking for speakers](https://2015.webcampzg.org/cfp/) and interesting topics. If you want to be a part of 
WebCamp as an attendee, note that tickets are selling fast at early bird price of 300 kn so we suggest you jump on them 
as soon as possible if you do not want to miss out. Alternatively, you can speak at your local user group and get 
a ticket for free. You can also [help our speakers by leaving a helpful feedback](http://joind.in/event/view/3497) on 
joind.in and we will draw one name that gets a free ticket as well.


Talks
=====
We had two amazing talks! [Slaven Vincetić](https://twitter.com/st00net) shared his tips and tricks for handling 
junior developers and encouraging senior developers to contribute with their experience in a talk named 
[Luke, I'm your father](/videos/zgphp-slaven-vincetic-luke-i-m-your-father). After the break, 
[Marin Crnković](http://blog.anorgan.com/) introduced us to [SaltStack](/videos/zgphp-marin-crnkovic-saltstack).


Next meetup
===========
We are busy preparing our next meetup - same place, same time: Mama, Preradovićeva 18 from 5:30pm. There will be talks
on Yii2 by Fatos Hoti and ZeroMQ by Silvio Marijić. [RSVP if you want to come](http://www.meetup.com/ZgPHP-meetup/events/205929152/).
