In the most outrageous session since that presentation on Node.js, we'll take a flagrant stab at the core ideals of this community by talking about an alternative implementation of PHP - HHVM, and a new not-entirely-unlike-PHP language for that runtime - Hack. We'll discuss key features, compatibility, reasons for naming a language "Hack", and the amount of time we'll spend burning in hell for challenging weak dynamic typing and Zend.
