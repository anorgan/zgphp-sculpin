Can Redis help you make your app run faster? Are there any jobs for which Redis is that right tool to use? Can you make apps using Redis even faster? If you wanna know answers to these questions and see how Redis helps us keep njuskalo.hr running this is the talk that you are looking for.  (spoiler alert: yes is answer to all these questions). 

Marijan is young developer willing to learn new things and explore new technologies. Likes to share his experience about what he knows and what he learned so far. Works for Trikoder d.o.o. and takes care of njuskalo.hr.
